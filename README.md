# First-R-Code
Law of Large Numbers in R
This code iterates through a specified number (N) of generated random numbers with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. It counts the number of generated random numbers that are between -1 and +1 and divides the count by N. Given a normal distribution, the result should be 68.2% (or 0.682). This is the percentage that falls within one standard devation of the mean in a normal distribution. In this code, N can be adjusted. As N rises, we expect the result to be closer and closer to 68.2%.
